# Personal Loan Prediction

Optimizing marketing campaigns using machine learning algorithms to better target customers who may purchase a personal loan. 
This report shall give you an overview of the key metrics derived using clustering and classification techniques and their interpretation. This will be achieved through visualisations and model performance measures. Report shall also elaborate future decisions the management may take to achieve their desired outcome based on our findings.  
 
The aim of this exercise is to facilitate the management of this bank in their decision making capability to increase revenue by earning interest on loans. We will support them by targeting the customers that have a relatively higher probability of opting for a personal loan. Our preliminary findings are based on a campaign run on liability customers last year where a success rate of slightly more than 9% was achieved. Among the 5000 people targeted in the campaign, only 9.6% (480) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them. 
The management wants to devise a marketing strategy where the success ratio increases with minimal budget, in other words we will build a model that will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. We are also supposed to explore ways to convert liability customers (depositors) to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.
